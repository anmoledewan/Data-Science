# Data Science Academy - Linear Models
- Collection of materials for DS Academy
# Content
- coursera_lectures: We have written the coursera material for the 'Regression Models' course in Python notebooks so that Python users can follow along
- lab_solutions: Sample answers to the Lab exercise questions. `.ipynb` files are for Python users and `.Rmd` files are for R users.
- app_templates: App dashboard templates for R Shiny and Python Dash

# Git First Timers
We don't want to overload you with numerous different tech stacks.
For the purpose of this course, it will be sufficient that you clone into this repo by running the following
command in your relevant local directory:

```
git clone https://spglobal.visualstudio.com/Mosaic/_git/DSA-Linear-Model 
```
If this prompts you for credentials, you can create it by:
1. Click on the 'Clone' button on the upper right panel
2. Create and confirm password. Then click on 'Save Git Credentials'
3. Use this user name and password for the credentials.
Whenever there are updates to the repository, you can sync your local version by running

```
git pull
```
Alternatively, you can just download materials by clicking 'Download as Zip' (but there would be some inconvenience
that you need to repeat this when you want to retrieve updated materials)

# Data Science Academy Python Package Requirements

This folder includes all codes for the Academy. 
For Python users, please make sure you install Python 3 and follow this instruction to install required packages.


### Prerequisites

If you prefer to use Conda to install all packages, please follow this link. 
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html

If you prefer to install the package on virtual environment, please follow this link to create a virtual environment first. 
https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/

then you could install the packages with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will see something like
```
Successfully installed pandas-0.24.2 statsmodels-0.10.0 
```

Now you should be able to run the code successfully.
